I just completed a project for the Fast Finder Search Bar hackathon by Innomatics Research Labs! 🎉

🔍 **Project Overview**: I created a search bar component that lets users search for countries by name or capital. It features:

- A sleek search bar on the homepage
- Real-time suggestions and autocomplete
- Efficient data retrieval from a JSON dataset

💻 **Tech Stack**:
- **React**: For the user interface
- **CSS**: For styling (or frameworks like Bootstrap/Tailwind)
- **Netlify/Vercel**: For deployment

**What I Learned**:
- Enhanced my React and frontend skills
- Built a responsive, user-friendly interface
- Gained experience in deploying apps on Netlify/Vercel

Thanks to Innomatics Research Labs for this great learning opportunity! Feel free to check out the demo or reach out if you want to chat tech!
